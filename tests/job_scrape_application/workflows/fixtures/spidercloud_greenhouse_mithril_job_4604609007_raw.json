Our mission is to orchestrate the world’s compute capacity, making it easier to use and optimized for AI workloads. We\\u0026#39;re building a new type of public cloud—one designed specifically for AI, where accessing high-performance compute is as simple and reliable as flipping a switch.\\u0026lt;/p\\u0026gt;\\n\\u0026lt;p\\u0026gt;Spun out of a Stanford PhD lab just over a year ago, Mithril has already gained the backing of top-tier investors like Sequoia, Lightspeed, Jeff Dean, Eric Schmidt, and others. With $80M in funding, we’ve secured customers and are generating revenue.\\u0026lt;/p\\u0026gt;\\n\\u0026lt;p\\u0026gt;Today’s machine learning infrastructure is overly complex. Engineers are forced to make tough decisions about hardware, when their focus should be on solving big problems and driving innovation. Our Omnicloud Platform changes that. By abstracting away hardware management and providing seamless access to compute resources, we enable engineers to focus on what really matters—building transformative AI solutions.\\u0026lt;/p\\u0026gt;\\n\\u0026lt;p\\u0026gt;We\\u0026#39;re not just making compute accessible; we\\u0026#39;re making it flexible, scalable, and tailored for the unique demands of AI. Our infrastructure marketplace brings the power of state-of-the-art hardware without the friction, allowing companies to innovate faster and more efficiently.\\u0026lt;/p\\u0026gt;\\n\\u0026lt;p\\u0026gt;\\u0026amp;nbsp;\\u0026lt;/p\\u0026gt;\\n\\u0026lt;h3\\u0026gt;\\u0026lt;strong\\u0026gt;Working at Mithril\\u0026lt;/strong\\u0026gt;\\u0026lt;/h3\\u0026gt;\\n\\u0026lt;p\\u0026gt;As a product engineer at Mithril, you’ll be at the forefront of building the applications and systems that power the future of AI. Your role is critical—not just in scaling our platform, but in ensuring that the user experience is seamless and the infrastructure behind it is robust and efficient. In an era where AI workloads are growing in complexity, crafting reliable and high-performance software is foundational to everything we build.\\u0026lt;/p\\u0026gt;\\n\\u0026lt;p\\u0026gt;Our Omnicloud Platform supports cutting-edge AI workloads, handling vast amounts of data while offering a user-friendly interface for developers and researchers. Product engineers at Mithril design and implement solutions across the entire stack—from building intuitive front-end interfaces to architecting scalable backend systems. We expect every engineer to approach problems holistically, balancing performance, scalability, and simplicity, all while keeping a keen eye on user experience.\\u0026lt;/p\\u0026gt;\\n\\u0026lt;p\\u0026gt;If you’re motivated by the challenge of building sophisticated applications that fuel AI innovation and thrive in a fast-paced, high-impact environment, Mithril is the place for you. Here, autonomy and ownership are paramount. You’ll have the freedom to make significant decisions, backed by a collaborative and inclusive team. Our flat structure ensures your ideas don’t get lost in hierarchy—every engineer shapes both the product and the company’s direction.\\u0026lt;/p\\u0026gt;\\n\\u0026lt;p\\u0026gt;At Mithril, we demand precision, clear communication, and relentless innovation in how we approach full stack product development.
