  <meta name="description" content="Lambda, The Superintelligence Cloud, is a leader in AI cloud infrastructure serving tens of thousands of customers. Our customers range from AI researchers to enterprises and hyperscalers. Lambda's mission is to make compute as ubiquitous as electricity and give everyone the power of superintelligence. One person, one GPU.

If you'd like to build the world's best AI cloud, join us.

*Note: This position requires presence in our San Jose office location 4 days per week; Lambda’s designated work from home day is currently Tuesday.


The Operations team plays a critical role in ensuring the seamless end-to-end execution of our AI-IaaS infrastructure and hardware. This team is responsible for sourcing all necessary infrastructure and components, overseeing day-to-day data center operations to maintain optimal performance and uptime, and driving cross company coordination through product management organization to align operational capabilities with strategic goals. By managing the full lifecycle from procurement to deployment and operational efficiency, the Operations team ensures that our AI-driven infrastructure is reliable, scalable, and aligned with business priorities.

What You’ll Do

 - Partner in leading the sourcing strategy for AI infrastructure components, including vendor sourcing for new products &amp; technologies

 - Develop category sourcing strategies to ensure suppliers are capable of meeting Lambda’s current and future technical and business requirements.

 - Build deep supplier engagement programs to secure critical allocations during constrained market conditions.

 - Establish the supplier selection process, evaluate alternate suppliers, drive the RFI/RFQ/RFP process, to improve the TCO and quality

 - Negotiate with suppliers and partners to establish best in class pricing, quality, delivery, payment, and service terms. Develop benchmarks and should cost models

 - Build an end to end OEM/ODM strategy to support Lambda’s growing cloud hardware scale

 - Establish and manage strategic supplier and commercial relationships with our key partners at the executive level. Influence supplier’s business models, roadmaps, and support models

 - Partner closely with Engineering, Data Center Operations, and Finance teams to align supplier capabilities with technical roadmaps and scaling needs.

 - Manage contractual agreements including master supply agreements, statements of work, and service level agreements.

 - Develop a supplier management framework, including QBRs, scorecards, and supplier performance (SLAs)&nbsp;

 - Monitor market dynamics (pricing, availability, emerging technologies) and advise on sourcing risk management strategies.

You&nbsp;

 - Bachelor’s degree in Supply Chain, Engineering, Business, or related field.

 - 10+ years of supply chain experience in data center, cloud, compute, networking, and/or AI hardware

 - Proven experience working with server, networking, storage, and/or data center technology vendors and OEMs.

 - Strong technical literacy — comfortable collaborating with engineers on component specifications, product architectures, and build materials (BOMs).

 - Exceptional negotiation and relationship management skills; capable of influencing internal and external stakeholders

 - Have direct experience managing OEMs, ODMs, and JDM suppliers and communicating with senior leadership

 - Deep understanding of cost structures, value chain analysis, and total cost of ownership (TCO) modeling

 - Experience in structuring, negotiating, and executing contracts (MSAs, MPAs, and SOWs) and complex agreements

 - Proficiency with supply chain management tools (e.g., ERP systems like NetSuite, SAP, Oracle).

 - Demonstrate sound interpersonal and communication skills, including presenting strategic decisions to the executive team

Nice to Have

 - Experience sourcing hardware for AI/ML infrastructure deployments (e.g., H100, B200 clusters).

 - Familiarity with sourcing and integration of liquid cooling infrastructure for high-density AI data centers.

 - Prior work with tier-1 hyperscale cloud providers or AI infrastructure startups.

 - Master’s degree (MBA, MS Supply Chain, or Engineering Management).
