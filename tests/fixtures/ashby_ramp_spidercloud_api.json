Success in this role requires intentional execution and adaptability to thrive in a culture where the best idea wins, where projects are built together, and where iteration is expected as part of the process.\n\nThis is a role for leaders who combine operational discipline with creativity. You’ll use data analysis, projects, and AI-driven workflows to help your team work smarter, while staying close enough to the ground to spot opportunities for improvement. Leadership here means more than managing schedules — it’s about shaping how your team performs, adapts, and thrives.\n\nIf you love developing people, driving accountability, and bringing clarity and focus to dynamic environments, this role is for you.\n\n\nWHAT YOU’LL DO\n\n - Develop and coach your team — run 1:1s, deliver feedback that drives improvement, and mentor agents to grow while holding them accountable for results.\n\n - Drive team performance and consistency — keep focus on key metrics (CSAT, QA, SLA, productivity) by reinforcing playbooks, SOPs, and coverage models, and addressing gaps quickly.\n\n - Lead quality assurance for your team — own case grading, run QA sessions, and identify knowledge or behavior gaps that impact performance.\n\n - Leverage data analysis to drive improvements — review performance trends and customer feedback to translate insights into coaching actions and process refinements.\n\n - Cultivate a positive, motivating culture — build an environment where agents feel recognized, supported, and inspired to deliver their best work.\n\n - Lead your team through change — ensure adoption of new workflows, tools, and AI-driven processes with clarity, communication, and steady leadership.\n\n - Foster collaboration across peers and leaders — engage in and model open feedback, idea-sharing, and cross-functional problem-solving.\n\n - Collaborate cross-functionally — partner with CX Ops, Product, and Engineering to surface issues, pilot improvements, and strengthen both the customer and agent experience.\n\n - Stay connected to the work — handle escalations and occasionally take calls and tickets to remain close to customer needs and frontline realities.\n\n\nWHAT YOU NEED\n\n - Ability to work evenings, weekends, and some holidays\n\n - Minimum 2 years of experience in a leadership role\n\n - Minimum 3 years of experience in a customer-facing technical support role\n\n - Excellent written and verbal communication\n\n - Proven ability to deliver tailored coaching that drives individual and team growth\n\n - Ability to juggle multiple tasks through effective time management and prioritization\n\n - Ability to confidently give and receive feedback across all levels, and to adapt ideas based on collective input.\n\n - Comfort leading teams through fast-paced change and adopting new tools, including AI\n\n\nNICE-TO-HAVES\n\n - Experience working in a high-growth or startup environment\n\n - Exposure to FinTech or financial services\n\n - Comfort experimenting with AI-powered tools or automation in customer support\n\nFor candidates located in NYC or SF, the pay range for this role is $96,000 - $132,000. For candidates located in all other locations, the pay range for this role is $88,000 - $121,000.\n\n\nBENEFITS (FOR U.S.-BASED FULL-TIME EMPLOYEES)\n\n - 100% medical, dental & vision insurance coverage for you\n   \n   - Partially covered for your dependents\n   \n   - One Medical annual membership\n\n - 401k (including employer match on contributions made while employed by Ramp)\n\n - Flexible PTO\n\n - Fertility HRA (up to $5,000 per year)\n\n - WFH stipend to support your home office needs\n\n - Wellness stipend\n\n - Parental Leave\n\n - Relocation support to NYC or SF (as needed)\n\n - Pet insurance\n\n\nREFERRAL INSTRUCTIONS\n\nIf you are being referred for the role, please contact that person to apply on your behalf.\n\n\nOTHER NOTICES\n\nPursuant to the San Francisco Fair Chance Ordinance, we will consider for employment qualified applicants with arrest and conviction records.\n\nRamp Applicant Privacy Notice https://ramp.com/legal/applicant-privacy-notice"

The Ramp team comprises talented leaders from leading financial services and fintech companies—Stripe, Affirm, Goldman Sachs, American Express, Mastercard, Visa, Capital One—as well as technology companies such as Meta, Uber, Netflix, Twitter, Dropbox, and Instacart.\n\nRamp has been named to Fast Company’s Most Innovative Companies https://www.fastcompany.com/91038883/ramp-most-innovative-companies-2024 list and LinkedIn’s Top U.S. Startups https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/linkedin-top-startups-2024-50-us-companies-rise-linkedin-news-hxote/?trackingId=uBI29YlAOxikbTI7cdvG4g%3D%3D for more than 3 years, as well as the Forbes Cloud 100 https://www.forbes.com/sites/richardnieva/2024/08/06/ramp-cloud-100/, CNBC Disruptor 50 https://www.cnbc.com/2024/05/14/ramp-cnbc-disruptor-50.html, and TIME Magazine’s 100 Most Influential Companies https://time.com/collection/time100-companies-2023/6285147/ramp/.\n\nWe’re looking for someone who gets a kick out of finding great designers and building a recruiting process from the ground up. You’ll help grow our Product Design org through major expansion, own full-cycle recruiting from sourcing to offer, and partner closely with design leadership and stakeholders across the company.\n\nWhat you’ll be doing\n\n - Work directly with Product Design leaders and hiring managers to really understand what makes a great designer at our company, and where new roles fit into our design & product roadmap\n\n - Run full-cycle recruiting for design hires, everything from building the pipeline to extending offers\n\n - Take ownership of sourcing: build your own candidate pipelines, craft thoughtful outreach, and connect with designers even before they’re actively looking\n\n - Build and evolve recruiting strategies that meet the speed and scale of our next “hypergrowth” phase. We don’t have a massive team, so flexibility and creativity matter\n\n - Do market mapping and research on design talent to help us stay competitive and informed about where strong candidates hang out\n\n - Keep our process running smoothly: track pipeline data, maintain candidate information, and surface insights and updates to internal stakeholders\n\n - Help close candidates. Manage offers, negotiate, and ensure we bring on great people who feel excited to join\n\n - Take initiative on projects that make recruiting better over time — whether that’s improvements to candidate experience, data tracking, or collaboration with design partners\n\n - Build strong relationships internally (with design, product, engineering) and with candidates so we’re always putting our best foot forward\n\nWho we’re looking for\n\n - 3+ years recruiting or sourcing experience, ideally focused on Design, UX, or other technical roles at a fast-growing tech company or startup\n\n - Strong sourcing chops, experience conducting creative outreach, and building pipelines from scratch\n\n - Real understanding of different design-related profiles (e.g. Product Designer, UX Researcher, Design Systems) and what makes them successful\n\n - You know how to tell a story about a role, the team, and what makes working here so unique\n\nWhy this role matters\n\nThis is a high-impact role: you’ll be the person who helps shape the future of our design org. Because we’re still small, the person in this role has a ton of ownership and visibility. You’ll directly influence who joins the team and how quickly we can grow.\n\n\nBENEFITS (FOR U.S.-BASED FULL-TIME EMPLOYEES)\n\n - 100% medical, dental & vision insurance coverage for you\n   \n   - Partially covered for your dependents\n   \n   - One Medical annual membership\n\n - 401k (including employer match on contributions made while employed by Ramp)\n\n - Flexible PTO\n\n - Fertility HRA (up to $5,000 per year)\n\n - WFH stipend to support your home office needs\n\n - Wellness stipend\n\n - Parental Leave\n\n - Relocation support to NYC or SF (as needed)\n\n - Pet insurance\n\n\nREFERRAL INSTRUCTIONS\n\nIf you are being referred for the role, please contact that person to apply on your behalf.\n\n\nOTHER NOTICES\n\nPursuant to the San Francisco Fair Chance Ordinance, we will consider for employment qualified applicants with arrest and conviction records.\n\nRamp Applicant Privacy Notice https://ramp.com/legal/applicant-privacy-notice"

This role is designed for someone who brings deep procurement domain expertise, technical implementation knowledge, and architect-level solution design skills to accelerate Ramp’s most complex, high-value enterprise evaluations.\n\nYou will support enterprise Account Executives and Solutions Consultants in running sophisticated procurement cycles end-to-end — leading deep discovery, validating technical requirements, designing future-state workflows, and creating pre-sale implementation plans that ensure a seamless handoff to onboarding.
