* Drive stability and scalability across all layers —databases, compute, deployments, and beyond
* Reduce operational friction by improving oncall, crafting elegant protocols, and streamlining incident response
* Invest in developer experience so the whole ENG team can iterate faster with less risk
* Anticipate scaling bottlenecks before they appear and take decisive action to stay ahead## **What you bring**

* Strong judgment under pressure and skill at making high-impact technical decisions
* Track record of building fault-tolerant distributed systems and modernizing release/deployment pipelines
