# Event Types

> Complete reference of all webhook events and when they trigger

This page covers all the different types of webhook events that Firecrawl can send to your endpoint. Each event type corresponds to a different stage in your scraping operations.

## Event Structure

All webhook events follow this basic structure:

```json  theme={null}
{
  "success": true,
  "type": "crawl.page",
  "id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
  "data": [...],
  "metadata": {}
}
```

### Common Fields

| Field      | Type    | Description                                       |
| ---------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `success`  | boolean | Whether the operation was successful              |
| `type`     | string  | Event type identifier                             |
| `id`       | string  | Unique identifier for the job                     |
| `data`     | array   | Event-specific data (varies by event type)        |
| `metadata` | object  | Custom metadata from your webhook configuration   |
| `error`    | string  | Error message (present when `success` is `false`) |

## Crawl Events

Multi-page crawling operations that follow links.

### `crawl.started`

Sent when a crawl operation begins.

```json  theme={null}
{
  "success": true,
  "type": "crawl.started",
  "id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
  "data": [],
  "metadata": {}
}
```

### `crawl.page`

Sent for each individual page that gets scraped during a crawl.

```json  theme={null}
{
  "success": true,
  "type": "crawl.page",
  "id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
  "data": [
    {
      "markdown": "# Welcome to our website\n\nThis is the main content of the page...",
      "metadata": {
        "title": "Page Title",
        "description": "Page description",
        "url": "https://example.com/page",
        "statusCode": 200,
        "contentType": "text/html",
        "scrapeId": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440001",

  "events": ["completed", "failed"]
}
```
